== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It's not working! =

You probably need to add the domain of your website to login.scouting.nl, you can only do this when you are logged in as a webmaster.
Check the [installation-tab](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsol/installation/) for a full explanation of how to do this.

= Do i need to be part of Scouting Nederland to use this? =

Yes, the OpenID-server is used to identify people and only allow access when they are a member of the right organisation within Scouting Nederland.
To setup the system at Scouting Nederland you need the webmaster-privilege for your scouting-group.

= Are there settings for this plugin? =

Yes, there is a settings-page where you can setup a redirect after login or logout and setup the Name the user gets in their profile and enforce that.
